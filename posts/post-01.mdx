We are excited to announce the latest update to NextUI, version **2.2.0**! This release introduces 3 new components,
support for client-side routing, and more.

## Sandpack demo

<Sandpack codeFiles={{ "App.tsx": app }} />

## What's New in v2.2.0?

- [Client Side Routing](#client-side-routing) - Allows you to seamlessly incorporate client-side routers.
- [Autocomplete](/docs/components/autocomplete) - Combines a text input with a listbox, allowing users to filter a list of options.
- [Slider](/docs/components/slider) - Allows users to make selections from a range of values.
- [Breadcrumbs](/docs/components/breadcrumbs) - Displays a hierarchy of links to the current page or resource in an application.
- [Other Changes](#other-changes) - Includes styling improvements, accessibility and usability enhancements.

## Client Side Routing

By default, links perform native browser navigation when they are interacted with. However, many apps and
frameworks use client side routers to avoid a full page reload when navigating between pages.

NextUI now natively supports client-side routing in components such as [Link](/docs/components/link), [Tabs](/docs/components/tabs),
[Breadcrumbs](/docs/components/breadcrumbs), [Listbox](/docs/components/listbox), [Dropdown](/docs/components/dropdown) and many others offering
the flexibility to be rendered as HTML links, allowing you to seamlessly incorporate client-side routers. See the [Routing](/docs/guide/routing) guide to
learn how it set it up in your app.

The `NextUIProvider` component configures all NextUI components within it to navigate using the
client side router you provide.

> **Note**: Client side routing is based on [React Aria Routing](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html).

### Next.js Example

- App Router

  Go to your `app/providers.tsx` or `app/providers.jsx` (create it if it doesn't exist) and add the
  `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation`, it returns a router object that can be used to perform navigation.

  ```tsx:app/providers.tsx {3-5,8}
  "use client";

  import { NextUIProvider } from "@nextui-org/react";

  export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    const router = useRouter();

    return <NextUIProvider navigate={router.push}>{children}</NextUIProvider>;
  }
  ```

- Pages Router

  Go to pages`/_app.js` or `pages/_app.tsx` (create it if it doesn't exist) and add the`useRouter` hook
  from `next/router`, it returns a router object that can be used to perform navigation.

  ```tsx {3-4}
  // pages/_app.tsx
  import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
  import { useRouter } from "next/router";
  import { NextUIProvider } from "@nextui-org/react";

  function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    const router = useRouter();

    return (
      <NextUIProvider navigate={router.push}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </NextUIProvider>
    );
  }

  export default MyApp;
  ```

- Usage

  Now that you have set up the `NextUIProvider` in your app, you can use the `href` prop in the `Tabs`,
  `Listbox` and `Dropdown` items to navigate between pages.

  The [Link](/docs/components/link) component will also use the `navigate` function from the
  `NextUIProvider` to navigate between pages.

  ```jsx
  import {
    Tabs,
    Tab,
    Listbox,
    ListboxItem,
    Dropdown,
    DropdownTrigger,
    DropdownMenu,
    DropdownItem,
    Button,
    Link,
  } from "@nextui-org/react";

  function App() {
    return (
      <>
        <Tabs aria-label="Navigation">
          <Tab key="home" href="/home">
            Home
          </Tab>
          <Tab key="about" href="/about">
            About
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        <Listbox aria-label="Navigation">
          <ListboxItem key="home" href="/home">
            Home
          </ListboxItem>
          <ListboxItem key="about" href="/about">
            About
          </ListboxItem>
        </Listbox>
        <Dropdown>
          <DropdownTrigger>
            <Button>Open</Button>
          </DropdownTrigger>
          <DropdownMenu aria-label="Navigation">
            <DropdownItem key="home" href="/home">
              Home
            </DropdownItem>
            <DropdownItem key="about" href="/about">
              About
            </DropdownItem>
          </DropdownMenu>
        </Dropdown>
        <Link href="/home">Home</Link>
        <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

## Autocomplete

Creating an autocomplete component that is both accessible and customizable is a challenging task. We've spent a lot of time
researching and testing different approaches to come up with a solution that works for everyone. The result is a
component that is easy to use, fully accessible, and highly customizable.

The new **Autocomplete** component includes:

- Support for selecting a single option.
- Support for disabled options.
- Support for groups of items in sections.
- Support for filtering a list of options by typing.
- Support for controlled and uncontrolled options, selection and input value.
- Support for custom filter functions.
- Async loading and infinite scrolling support.
- Required and invalid states exposed to assistive technology via ARIA.
- Support for description and error message help text linked to the input via ARIA.
- And much more...

about the Autocomplete component.
